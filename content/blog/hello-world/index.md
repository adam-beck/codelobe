Welcome!

This is more or less a placeholder post before I start to get real content up. I am migrating
my abandoned blog from Ghost to GatsbyJS in the hopes of giving it the attention it deserves. This
blog will mostly be a reference for myself on the aspects of development I often find myself having
to look up time and time again.

Topics will range from front-end, to back-end, and devops. I enjoy working with Docker and writing
APIs with Node and GraphQL. Most of the tools used here are not tools I get to enjoy at my daily
job. So this blog is sort of a escape to better hone my skills and to experience what the community
has to offer.
